The data within this repository corresponds to estimation of water withdrawal and consumption (for electricity production only) at the county resolution on an annual time step from 1950 to 2016. Water withdrawal and consumption for electricity production are also provided at the electric generating unit resolution. Additionally, irrigation data was calculated at the daily time step
